        <h4 style="color: darkolivegreen;">HISTORY OF VVES</h4>
        <p class="text">
          Education being the basic need of the society, Vidya Vikas Education Society was founded
          with the goal of providing need- based education to the poor sections of society.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          With only one room on rental basis as the only infrastructure, the first night school was started at
          Pantnagar, Ghatkopar in 1963. Considering the needs of expansion in 1969, the institution succeeded in
          getting twelve rooms on rental basis from Maharashtra Housing Board at Kannamwar Nagar, Vikhroli.
          Beginning with this, facing a number of difficulties, with a great determination and persistent efforts,
          Vidya Vikas Education Society continued its journey towards progress and there was no looking back.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          It was in 1974 that after a long process of reclaiming the waste land in Kannamwar Nagar, Vikhroli,
          the foundation was laid for the present building of the institution.
          Planted in one room at Pantnagar, Ghatkopar, this tree of Knowledge has grown up with the following
          24 branches of education.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          With an objective of holding light to those in darkness and extending support to helpless and guide
          those who have lost direction, our kind hearted, socially concerned and dedicated reformers laid down
          the foundation of Vidya Vikas Education Society in 1962, to impart higher education to the masses,
          especially,the weaker and underprivileged sections of society. Late Dr. W.S. Matkar, Ex. MLA.,
          Maharashtra State, Late Dr. Datta Samant, Renowned Trade Unionist and Ex. MP, Union of India and
          Shri P.M. Raut, Recipient of the National Award for Teaching and present secretary of the institution
          are the founder members of the institution. The institution could reach a remarkable milestone in the
          field of education in a very short span of time. Started with an initial strength of 260students, it
          has now grown up both qualitatively & quantitatively in to 19 educational units imparting knowledge
          to more than 15,000 students from KG level to PG level.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          All the members of Vidya Vikas Education Society family are fortunate to be guided and supported in
          their mission of education by Shri P.M. Raut, Secretary, Vidya Vikas Education Society and Mrs. Vidya
          P.Raut, Chief Executive Officer of the institution, both being the recipient of the National Award for
